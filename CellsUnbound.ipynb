    "Cancer cells are different from normal cells in many subtle ways. In order to develop drugs to control cancer, researchers must develop tools that recognize these differences. Whether the tools are designed to kill cells or prevent their spread, they must have the ability to distinguish cancer from normal tissue. Refining this ability is essential to finding more effective and less damaging therapies.\n",
